## Description

The project aims to analyze audio files and extract various metrics that can be useful for studies or research on the quality and characteristics of audio. Some of the extracted metrics include:

- Signal entropy
- Low-frequency noise indicators
- Audio channel analysis (mono or stereo)
- Detection of intermediate silences
- Detection of volume distortions

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7+ installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:
